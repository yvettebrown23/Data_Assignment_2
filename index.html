<p> The Food and Drug Administration approved kids from the ages of five and 11 to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, as of last week.  According to sources, more than 51,000 kids in New York City, under the age of 11 have received their first dose of the vaccine. </p>

<p> "With the group right ahead, the 12–17-year-olds, a group that has been vaccinated over the last few months, we're almost at 80 percent there,” Mayor Bill de Blasio told WNYC.  “And we continue to make progress every day, so that to me is, let's focus on getting kids vaccinated, make sure every kid's in school." </p>

<p> Data shows that as Nov. 11, 2021, 21 percent of kids under 18 have received at least one dose, while 24 percent have been fully vaccinated.  About 75 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 24 have been fully vaccinated, while 87 percent have received at least one dose. </p>
